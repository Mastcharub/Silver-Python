## What is Silver-Python ?
Silver-Python is a compiler / environment for the Python language, which adds: optional types and pointers in C/C++ style (which eliminates the garbage collector). Silver-Python is highly inspired by the existence of IronPython (https://ironpython.net/)

## Other Information
The Parser and the Tree AST are "stolen" from the original python repo
